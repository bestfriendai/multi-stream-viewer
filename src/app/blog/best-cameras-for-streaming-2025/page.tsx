## Camera Settings for Optimal Streaming

### Webcam Settings
1. **Resolution**: 1080p for most streams
2. **Frame Rate**: 30fps minimum, 60fps preferred
3. **Exposure**: Manual control when possible
4. **White Balance**: Match your lighting (usually 5600K)
5. **Focus**: Set and forget for consistency

### DSLR/Mirrorless Settings
1. **Mode**: Manual (M) for full control
2. **Shutter Speed**: 1/60 for 30fps, 1/125 for 60fps
3. **ISO**: As low as possible (100-800)
4. **Aperture**: f/2.8-f/4 for good depth
5. **Picture Profile**: Natural or Log for post-processing

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Overbuying for Your Needs
A 4K camera won't improve your stream if you're broadcasting at 720p. Match your camera to your actual streaming quality.

### 2. Ignoring Lighting
A $100 webcam with good lighting beats a $1000 camera in darkness. Invest in proper lighting before upgrading cameras.

### 3. Forgetting About Processing Power
4K streaming requires significant CPU/GPU resources. Ensure your system can handle your camera choice.

### 4. Neglecting Audio
Viewers forgive poor video but not poor audio. Don't rely on camera microphones for primary audio.
