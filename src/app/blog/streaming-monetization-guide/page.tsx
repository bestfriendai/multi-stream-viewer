## Understanding the Monetization Landscape

### The Reality Check
Let's start with honest numbers:

- **Top 10%** make $1,000-$10,000 annually
- **Bottom 90%** make less than $1,000 annually

But here's the key: Multiple revenue streams can move you up these tiers faster than relying on one source.

## Common Monetization Mistakes

### 1. Starting Too Early
Build value before asking for money. Focus on content quality and community first.

### 2. Undervaluing Your Worth
Don't accept the first sponsorship offer. Know your value and negotiate.

### 3. Ignoring Taxes
Set aside 25-30% of earnings for taxes. Quarterly payments prevent surprises.

### 4. Single Revenue Dependence
Platform changes can kill income overnight. Diversify immediately.

### 5. Burning Out Supporters
Balance monetization with free value. Don't make everything transactional.
