# Mobile Layout Fix Plan

## Issues Identified
1. Stack mode not responsive - streams don't use full width
2. Grid button doesn't work in swipe mode
3. "Preparing your stream..." overlays instead of actual content
4. Layout controls not functioning properly

## Todo List

### Core Layout Fixes
- [ ] **Fix Stack Mode Responsiveness** - Change aspect ratios from 1:1 to full-width rectangles in EnhancedMobileLayout.tsx
- [ ] **Fix Grid Button Access** - Ensure layout controls are always accessible in swipe mode
- [ ] **Fix Stream Loading Issues** - Investigate and fix "Preparing your stream..." overlays in StreamEmbedOptimized.tsx
- [ ] **Connect Mobile Nav Layout Button** - Make the layout dropdown in MobileNav.tsx functional

### Testing & Verification
- [ ] **Test Stack Mode** - Verify streams use full width and are properly responsive
- [ ] **Test Layout Switching** - Verify all layout modes (Stack, Grid, Swipe) work correctly
- [ ] **Test Stream Loading** - Verify streams load properly without persistent loading states
- [ ] **Test Mobile Navigation** - Verify layout switching works from bottom nav

### Final Review
- [ ] **Review Changes** - Document all changes made and verify no regressions
- [ ] **Test All Mobile Modes** - Full mobile layout testing across all view modes

## Notes
- Focus on simple, minimal changes to avoid complexity
- Each fix should impact as little code as possible
- Test thoroughly on mobile viewport sizes
